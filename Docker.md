## Docker Basics

### What is Docker?
Think of Docker as a standardized shipping container for software. Just as shipping containers revolutionized physical goods transport by providing a standard way to package and move items, Docker does the same for software.

**Key Intuition:**
- **Container vs VM**: If a VM is like a fully furnished house (heavy, complete OS), a container is like a lightweight apartment that shares building infrastructure
- **Isolation**: Each container is like a sandbox - what happens inside stays inside
- **Portability**: "It works on my machine" becomes "It works everywhere" because everything the app needs is packaged together

### Key Components
Imagine building and shipping a product:
- **Docker Engine**: The factory and shipping system (runs and manages containers)
- **Docker Images**: The product blueprint (template for containers)
- **Docker Containers**: The actual product being shipped (running instance)
- **Docker Registry**: The warehouse (stores images)
- **Dockerfile**: The manufacturing instructions (how to build the image)

### Basic Dockerfile Example
```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements file
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 80

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

**Understanding Each Step:**
1. `FROM`: Like choosing the foundation (base OS and runtime)
2. `WORKDIR`: Setting up your workspace (like cd command)
3. `COPY`: Moving files into the container (like copying files to a new computer)
4. `RUN`: Executing commands during build (like setting up a new computer)
5. `EXPOSE`: Declaring which ports to open (like setting up a reception desk)
6. `CMD`: What to run when starting (like the startup command)

### Common Docker Commands

Think of these commands as:
- Building a house (`docker build`)
- Moving in (`docker run`)
- Checking who's home (`docker ps`)
- Moving out (`docker stop`, `docker rm`)
- Home maintenance (`docker logs`, `docker inspect`)

#### Image Management
```bash
# Build an image (like creating a blueprint)
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .

# List images (like listing available blueprints)
docker images

# Remove image (like throwing away a blueprint)
docker rmi myapp:1.0

# Pull image (like getting a blueprint from a catalog)
docker pull nginx:latest
```

#### Container Management
```bash
# Run a container (like creating a house from blueprint)
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name mycontainer myapp:1.0
# -d: run in background (like a daemon)
# -p: port mapping (like connecting house to street)
# --name: give it a name (like naming your house)

# List running containers (like checking occupied houses)
docker ps

# Stop container (like temporarily closing the house)
docker stop mycontainer

# Remove container (like demolishing the house)
docker rm mycontainer

# View container logs (like checking security cameras)
docker logs mycontainer
```

## Docker Networking

Think of Docker networking like a city's road system:

### Network Types

#### Bridge Network (Default)
Like a private neighborhood:
- Each container is a house
- They can talk to each other
- They need explicit permission to talk to the outside world

```bash
# Create bridge network (like creating a new neighborhood)
docker network create mynetwork

# Run container in network (like building a house in the neighborhood)
docker run --network=mynetwork myapp
```

#### Host Network
Like removing property boundaries:
- Container uses host's network directly
- Faster but less secure
- No isolation between container and host

```bash
# Run container with host network (like building with no property boundary)
docker run --network=host myapp
```

#### None Network
Like a completely isolated building:
- No network connectivity
- Maximum security
- Useful for processing-only tasks

### Network Commands
```bash
# List networks (like viewing all neighborhoods)
docker network ls

# Inspect network (like getting neighborhood details)
docker network inspect mynetwork

# Connect container to network (like moving to a neighborhood)
docker network connect mynetwork container1
```

## Docker Volumes

Think of volumes as external storage solutions:

### Volume Types

#### Named Volumes
Like having a dedicated storage unit:
- Managed by Docker
- Persistent data
- Easy to backup

```bash
# Create named volume (like renting a storage unit)
docker volume create mydata

# Use volume (like connecting storage to your house)
docker run -v mydata:/app/data myapp
```

#### Bind Mounts
Like having a door connecting two rooms:
- Direct connection to host filesystem
- Great for development
- Real-time file updates

```bash
# Mount local directory (like connecting two rooms)
docker run -v $(pwd):/app myapp
```

## Docker Compose

Think of Docker Compose as a blueprint for a whole apartment complex:
- Multiple containers (apartments)
- Shared resources (common areas)
- Defined relationships (who can access what)

### Multi-Container Applications
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  # Front desk (web server)
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  
  # Storage room (redis cache)
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
  
  # Filing cabinet (database)
  db:
    image: "postgres:13"
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db-data:  # Permanent storage room
```
